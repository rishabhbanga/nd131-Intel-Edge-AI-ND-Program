## [Deploy a People Counter App at the Edge](https://github.com/rishabhbanga/nd131-Intel-Edge-AI-ND-Program/tree/master/P1-People_Counter_App_on_Edge)

The people counter app at the edge is the first project aimed at instructing users on how to develop a working solution for counting people. It demonstrates how to create a smart video IoT solution using Intel® hardware and software tools. This solution detects people in a designated area, providing the number of people in the frame, average duration of people in frame, and total count.

Some of the potential use cases of the people counter app are</br>
1. To count number of people entering a mall.</br>
2. To count number of people entering a shop and verify how many people actually buy stuff.</br>
3. To count number of people entering a public spaces such as exhibits.</br>

Each of these use cases would be useful respectively:</br>
1. Malls can identify footfall patterns and accordingly plan activties to rope in people on high/low footfall days.</br>
2. Stores could calculate their conversion ratio, footfall patterns, etc.</br>
3. Public Spaces can idenitfy crowd favorites and identify footfall pattern to deploy staff effectively.</br>
